Very poor product. Note it No any Air Flow even for a new born Baby.",N/A,"The media could not be loaded.
                



1. Very poor product 2. The cooling pads coming  2. The fan speed is slow even at 3 speed even for a new born baby, no any air flow. Very small product as said in advertisement no any air breeze in real product. Not recommended to buy. Waste of time and money because as said by non returnable, you have to make many calls and uploads even for a prime customer to request for return to investigation team."

Speed of fan and size of product",N/A,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Product is very small and fan rotation is very slow even in high speed mode its just rotating itself no air like a foam, i dint expect this much worse. Dont buy it such a bad product. we have to sit near maximum of 2 inches distance to get air. There is no foam no air like mentioned in the product informationHow can sell like these product, they didnt even mention the height of the product, it came my palm size only"

Worst product. No air flow felt.",N/A,"Too small product to provide any reasonable air flow which is never felt even at full speed. I peeped in to see if fan was rotating. No return available too for rhe product. So, don't make a mistake to buy this item and waste your precious money. Amazon should ban such products and sellers to protect customers from being cheated like this. (0 rating not allowed. So, i had to choose 1)."
